DOUBLE LOOP
URETERAL STENT

AMECATH DOUBLE LOOP URETERAL STENT Home Care

At hospital discharge, your doctor or nurse will give you instructions for rest, driving, and doing
physical activities after the procedure.

Because surgical instruments were inserted into your urinary tract, you may experience urinary
symptoms for some time after surgery. These symptoms usually disappear in a few weeks.

Symptoms may include:
Mild burning feeling when urinating
Small amounts of blood in the urine
Mild discomfort in the bladder area or kidney area when urinating
- Need to urinate more frequently or urgently
- Pain resulting from an internal abrasion that needs time to heal
WHAT CARE DO | NEED TO TAKE?

Try to drink fluids often but in small quantities. Sometimes a blood clot can cause pain (colic). The
urine contains a substance (called urokinase) that will dissolve this clot.

Itis essential that you drink at least 1.5 to 2 litters (approximately four pints) of fluids, mainly water,
per day. This will help to cut down the risk of getting an infection X will reduce the amount of
blood in the urine. It will also help in the treatment of stones. If you experience bother some pain
you can take painkillers for relief, on the advice of a doctor. If you have got a stent with a thread
coming down from the urethra outside the body, then more care will be needed so as not to
dislodge the thread. If in any doubt please seek medical help.

Note: If the pain remains despite use of pain medication, contact the hospital or your doctor.

Call your doctor or nurse immediately ¡f:

- You have a fever higher than 38.5*C

- Warning: Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to treat or prevent an infection or to relieve
your pain. Report any signs of infection--including severe pain, chills, or fever—to your doctor
right away.

- You experience a serious burning sensation (not mild) when urinating

- Youare unable to urinate

- You see large amounts of blood in your urine and it does not go away with rest and hydration

- You continue to have severe pain in your side, despite use of pain medication
- Tell your doctor right away if bleeding or pain is severe or if problems last longer or worsen

after you go home from the hospital.
LIVING WITH A URETERIC STENT

Ureteric stents are designed to allow people to lead as normal a life as possible. However, they
may not be without side effects. In placing a stent, there is a balance between its advantages in
relieving the obstruction and any possible disadvantages in the form of side effects. Most side
effects are not a danger to your health or your kidneys, although they can be a nuisance. Below,
e have described all the possible side effects associated with a self-retained ureteric stent. You
may experience none, some occasionally or a few of them.

Many patients do not experience problems with the stents. In the majority of the patients
experiencing side effects they are minor and tolerable. However, sometimes they can be
moderate to severe in nature.

COMMONLY NOTED SIDE EFFECTS ARE:
The majority of patients with a stent in place will be aware of its presence most of the time.
Urinary symptoms There might be:
- Aniincreased frequency of passing urine. The need to rush to pass urine

-A small amount of blood in the urine is quite common and the situation can improve with a

greater fluid intake.

- - Very occasionally, the stents can also result in a sensation of incomplete emptying of the
bladder. Especially in women, there is a slight risk of incontinence episodes.

—These effects are possibly due to the presence of the stent inside the bladder causing
mechanical irritation. These effects resolve when the stent is removed.

- Discomfort or pain: stents can cause discomfort or pain, commoniy in the bladder and
kidney (loin) area, but sometimes in other areas such as the groin, urethra and genitals. The
discomfort pain may be more noticeable after physical activities and after passing urine.

Complete understanding of these side effects and their causes is not clear at present. It has
also not been possible to predict, before placement of a stent, which patients are likely to
experience side effects and what they will be.

There is some evidence that some of the symptoms, such as pain while passing urine and blood in
the urine, may improve with time. However, this remains unpredictable.

It has been reported that around 20 - 70% of patients with a stent experience 1 or more of these
side-effects.

Medical science and the stent manufacturers are working to develop a stent that will cause the
least possible side effects.

You can carry on with various physical activities, while the stent.is in place provided the underlying
kidney condition and your health allows you to do it. However, you may experience some
discomfort in the kidney area and passing of bloody urine, especially if sports and strenuous
physical activities are involved. Sometimes side effects associated with a stent can make you
feel more tired than normal.

You can continue to work normally with the stent inside your body. However, if the work involves
lot of physical activities, you may experience more discomfort. Occasionally, side effects, such
as urinary symptoms and pain associated with the stent, may make you feel tired. Repeatable
urination may cause disturbance with your manager and colleagues temporary adjustments can
be made at your work place. The presence of a stent should not affect this in a significant way.
In case you get urinary symptoms such as, increased frequency and urgency, you may need to
use public toilets more frequently while taking part in outdoor activities. Occasionally you may
need a little more help from family members or colleagues, because of any pain or tiredness
you may feel. There are no restrictions on your sexual habits due to the presence of a stent. Few
patients experience discomfort during sexual activities. Occasionally the side effect associated
with the stent may have an effect on the sexual desire. If you have a stent with a thread
coming outside the body through the urethra, sexual activities may be difficult. Care will also be
required so as not to dislodge the thread, which could then in turn displace the stent.

Occasionally, a stent may develop a crystal coating on its surface. Usually, this is not a significant
problem. Very occasionally, a stent may get displaced, usually slipping towards the bladder, and
it may even fall out.

If this happens, you should contact the hospital or your GP.
