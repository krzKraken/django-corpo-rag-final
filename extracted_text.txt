PERCUTANEOUS
NEPHROSTOMY CATHETERS

AMECATH Percutaneous Nephrostomy Catheter Home Care
This handout covers information about caring for your Nephrostomy Catheter right after placement. IF
you have any questions, please call your healthcare provider.

Your recovery after the catheter is placed
You were given medicine through your IV for sedation during the placement of your catheter, along
with some local anesthetic to numb the entry site. This may cause you to feel sleepy, dizzy or tired for

hours after the catheter is placed.
Here are some guidelines to follow for the first 24 to 48 hours after your catheter is put in:

- Go home and rest for the remainder of the day.

- Do not drive or work around any mechanical equipment, power tools or appliance or sharp objects

until the next day after your catheter was placed.

Avoid making any major life or legal decisions for at least 24 hours after the sedation because you
may not be able to think clearly or remember your actions.

Eat light foods, like jelly, pudding, soups, juices and other liquids for the rest of first day. Start back
'on your usual diet as tolerated after the procedure.

- Take your usual medicines when you get back home.

Your IV site may be tender for a day or two. You may use warm moist compresses on it for 20
minutes every day. If the site gets more red, swollen or tender after 2 or 3 days, call your doctor.

- Some bruising or tenderness at the site of the catheter is common. It may be very mild bruising to
black and blue, and it may be very small to about the size of a golf ball. These signs may last for 2
weeks or longer. Apply warm moist compresses to the site for 20 minutes 2 or 3 times a day to help
wWith comfort. Be sure to cover your dressing with plastic wrap first to keep it dry.

Check your temperature every day that you have the catheter in place.
Skm care and showering

- Keep the skin around your tube dry. When you shower, if your tube area gets wet, dry the skin
completely.

- You may take a shower 48 hours after the catheter is placed, but you need to keep the site dry.

- Before you shower, cover the catheter dressing and the skin around the site with plastic wrap taped

to your skin. You must cover the site for 14 days after placement.

After 14 days, if the site has healed, you can shower without the dressing and plastic wrap. After the
end of your shower, use a clean washcloth and liquid antibacterial soap like Dial with water to clean
the site. Then rinse the site well with plain water. Pat the drain site gently with a towel to dry.

- Bathing in a tub, using a hot tub or swimming is not recommended as long as you have the catheter
in place.

Dressing change
A gauze dressing should be changed every other day, but a transparent dressing is changed every 72
hours. Either dressing should be changed if it gets wet or the edges become loose.

Steps

1. Gather your supplies.

- 2 pairsof nonssterile gloves
Cotton swabs or clean washcloths
Antibacterial soap

- 4>4 gauze split dressings (package of two)
Paper tape if gauze dressing is used

- Small plastic garbage bag

2. Wash your hands with soap and water for 15 seconds. Rinse and towel dry.

3. Put on the non-sterile gloves.

4. Carefully remove the old dressing to avoid dislodging the catheter. Note soreness, redness, drainage
or odor at the site where the catheter goes through the skin. These signs may indicate infection. If
any of these signs are noted, clean the skin site and change the dressing more often for one week.
If the signs do not improve right away, call your doctor.

MECATH Home Care

. Remove the non-sterile gloves and wash your hands again. Then put on the other clean pair of
gloves
Clean the skin around the catheter (exit site) with a cotton swab or clean washcloth wet with liquid
antibacterial soap and water. Use a circular motion moving outward from the center to about 3
inches. Repeat this step with the second swab or washcloth, and more if needed to remove any
crusting. Let the area air dry. Do not fan it to speed the drying because that will put more germs
near the site. If the antibacterial soap irritates your skin, use sterile saline to clean the site.
7. Apply one sterile 4x4 gauze pad around the tube. Be careful not to touch the pad where it will be
placed over the catheter.
8. Use a second gauze dressing, placed over the first one to cover the tube.
9. Tape over the gauze pad with the paper tape. Be sure to pinch the tape around the tube.
10.Throw the old dressing, gloves, used swabs and wrappings in the plastic bag. Remove the gloves
and put them in the bag. Tie the bag shut and put it in a trash can.
T. Wash your hands with soap and warm water. Rinse and towel dry.
Care of Your Drainage Bag
- Empty your drainage bag as often as needed when it is about 2/3 full. Turn the knob at the bottom
of the bag and drain it into a measuring container. Keep track of the amount of drainage each day.
- You should not clean the drainage bag. You will be sent home with an extra drainage bag to use if
there is a leak in the bag or the bag or tubing gets damaged.
Spec¡al Precautions and Complications
Keep the drainage bag below the level of your kidneys at all times, to prevent a back flow of urine
into the kidneys.
- To prevent sludge and calculi or stones from forming, drink 6 to 8 glasses (8-0unce glass) of fluids a
day.
- Keep your Nephrostomy Catheter drainage bag closed to reduce risk of infection.
- Keep the Nephrostomy Catheter and drainage bag tubing free of twists, kinks or leaks.
- There should be no pulling or stretching on the tube connected to the bag.
+ Check the tube to make sure it is in place after you shower, change your clothes or do other
activities.
- Make sure you empty the bag often. This will prevent pulling on the tube and help keep it in place.
*N. B: While Ieaving the hospital / medical care center, the nephrostomy tube will be stitched in place
and will exit the skin from the side of the patients back. The tube will be attached to a drainage
bag which is usually worn under your clothing and can either be strapped to the thigh or secured to
clothing with a safety pin. It is important NOT to leave the bag hanging as the weight of the urine and
any tugging may cause the nephrostomy tube to fall
When to Call Your Doctor
- Sudden decrease in the amount of drainage with discomfort at the catheter site
- Blood in or around your catheter
- Fever greater than 101 degrees F (38.5"C)
Persistent blood in the urine

-

- Nausea and vomiting

-- Chills

- - Urine that is cloudy or has a strong odor
- Back pain

Catheter becomes dislodged or broken
Catheter begins to leak

- Catheter is blocked

-- ¡f the bag stops collecting urine

*If you experience any symptoms or undesirable effects, kindly contact your health care provider.

Each carton box includes 10 AMECATH Percutaneous Nephrostomy Catheters kits packed in blister
tray covered with blister then packed in window bag.

AMECATH Percutaneous Nephrostomy Catheter method of application

1.. The patient is commonly placed in a prone or prone-oblique position, the side to be punctured is
elevated. The body site where the device will be inserted should be evaluated with sonography, CT,
or fluoroscopy and also should be marked. This body site should then be prepared (e.g., cleansed
with Betadine solution) and draped in the usual manner. The patient is given an appropriate
medication for conscious sedation (e.g., fentanyl and Versed) and a local anesthetic, usually 1%
lidocaine to anesthetize the skin.

2. A small skin incision is made to facilitate passage of the needle into the skin.

3. Puncture site selection is crucial in minimizing the risk of hemorrhage. The best route for needie
entry into the renal collecting system is through an oblique posterolateral approach along the Bródel
line and into the end of a posterior calix. This line is near the posterior axillary line and is about 2-3
m below the 12th rib. A percutaneous nephrostomy tract that approaches along Brédel line has the
smallest risk of causing substantial arterial injury and subsequent hemorrhage.

4. The needle is angled toward a posterior lower or middle pole calix. Once the needle is inserted into

the calix and into the collecting system, the stylet is removed, and urine is returned if an obstruction
is present. If no urine is present, a few maneuvers can be used. A 10-mL syringe should be attached
to the needle hub, and the needle and syringe should be retracted slightly. If urine is aspirated, the
tip is likely within the collecting system. Otherwise, a 0.018” wire can be used to probe the region, or
a small amount of contrast agent can be injected to check the position.

5. Contrast material should be gentiy injected into the collecting system to confirm the location. Over
distension of the system with contrast material or the withdrawal of too much urine for culturing
should be avoided. In commoniy practice, the amount of contrast agent to inject is the same as the
amount of urine removed

6. Once access into the collecting system is obtained, successful wire exchanges should occur until a
0.035” J-tip wire is placed into the renal pelvis or down the ureter.

7. The tract should be dilated with dilators.

8. The drainage catheter should be flushed, and the Straightener that comes with the kit should be
used.

9. The catheter should be advanced into the proximal renal parenchyma over a 0.035” guide wire, the
trocar should be loosened, and the catheter should be slipped off the trocar into the renal pelvis.
The internal wire should be pulled to lock the pigtail catheter, and the catheter should be seated
appropriately within the renal pelvis. The catheter position should be confirmed with the use of
contrast material, and the catheter should be fixed with the fixation wings and tied to the skin with
suture and attached to an external drainage bag.

91 N.B. For One Step nephrostomy application the most dilated portion of the kidney is assessed
ultrasonographically and with its puncture needle is applied on the puncture line to the kidney in
only one step then with removal of the trocar and passage of urine to be sure that the catheter is
in the renal pelvis, then the cannula is removed and the catheter will re-coil to take its original pig
tail shape.

kidney that in need for rapid urinary diversion or can't withstand major procedure up to improving
the general condition of the patient.
